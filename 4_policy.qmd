# Policy

## Before the practical session

**For the practical session** this week **come prepared to talk** about the following:

- Search for one metropolitan policy challenge (any city in the World) that could be solved by incorporating remotely sensed data

- Identify and evaluate a remotely sensed data set that could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal

-  Demonstrate how this links to global agendas / goals

- Explain how it advances current local, national or global approaches.

Cities will have a diverse range of documentation available...

## After the practical session

**Following the practical and subsequent discussion** write up your case study city in three paragraphs, you should:

* Detail the relevant policy that can be assisted with remotely sensed data
* Evaluate how remotely sensed data set(s) could used to assist with contributing to the policy goal
* Place it within local / global agendas and current approaches
* Cite the relevant policy and where appropriate literature.

Should you struggle to find current approaches within your city explore other cities discussed within the practical.
