## Welcome {.unnumbered}

Hello <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="general_images/casa_logo.jpg" alt="CASA0023 course" width="120" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em"/></a> and welcome to the Term 2 module Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments.

Similarly, to my Term 1 MSc module, CASA0005, this website holds all the practical instructions for the module. [CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/) (or a similar module) is a pre-requisite of this module so concepts taught there will mainly be assumed here.

The R package and analysis artwork used within this book has been produced by [allison_horst](https://twitter.com/allison_horst), whilst artwork used in information boxes has been produced by [Desirée De Leon](https://twitter.com/dcossyle). You can find Allison's images on the [stats illustration GitHub repository](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations) and Desirée's on the [rstudio4edu GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio4edu/rmd4edu).

I've certainly learnt a lot from their open code repositories!
