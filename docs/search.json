    "text": "1.1 Learning outcomes\nBy the end of this practical you should be able to:\n\nSource, load and articulate the differences between Landsat and Sentinel data\nUndertake basic raster image statistics and processing\nEvaluate the (dis)advantages of each type of software you have used\nPull out and statistically compare spectral signatures\n\n\n1.1.1 Sentinel download\n\nGo to the Copernicus Open Access Hub\n\nYou will need to make a free account\n\nDraw around the study area\nSelect image filter criteria\nSelect search icon\nDownload the S2MSI2A data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this image we have:\n\nAllows you to either move around the global or draw a study area\nAn example of a study area\nHow to sort the image results\nSentinel mission selection :\n\n\nSentinel product types refer to the amount of processing that has been undertaken on the multi-spectral imagery. S2MSI2A = Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) or otherwise known as surface reflectance. Consult the product specification for more details.\n\nYou can also use the Sentinel 2 toolbox to replicate the conversation from TOA to BOA\n\nThe platform refers to either sentinel 2A or 2B. Theses are the same sensors but they operate at 180 degrees from each other reducing the revisit time from 10 to 5 days. 2A was launched first in 2015 followed by 2B in 2017.\nCloud cover e.g. [0 TO 5]\n\n\n1.1.1.1 Open\nOnce downloaded and unzipped you’ll be presented with a load of folders! Here we are interested in the 10m bands…which are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll find then in the GRANULE > sensor number > IMG_DATA > R10.\nNext open them up in QGIS for some exploration, if there is a TCI image this is a True Colour Image of B02 (Blue), B03 (Green), and B04 (Red) Bands - open this first, it’s just a single raster layer. See the Sentinel user guide definitions for any other acronyms you might need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Identify tool we can create a spectral signature by changing the view option to graph (look under the graph in the image above).\nHowever the TCI values are coded between 0 and 255 which will limit what we can do with it. As the the radiometric resolution of Sentinel-2 is 12-bit, meaning brightness levels from 0 - 4095 it’s not clear how this product has been made.\nSo we can make our own raster stack using the BOA bands, if you recall we did this in CASA0005 in R.\nBut in QGIS it’s easier to visualise the output\nFind the merge tool from the Raster miscellaneous tool box and select the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe input layers are the four 10m bands that I loaded into QGIS\nThe tick box selected meaning each raster file will be it’s own layer\nThe file being saved into a .tiff as opposed to memory\n\nOnce merged we can created a true colour composite using the BOA data…to do so:\n\nRight click on the merged layer in the attribute table\nSymbology > Render type > select multiband color\n\nIn remote sensing the Red, Green, Blue display options are often called colour guns that are used to display images on the screen. For a true colour composite B1=Blue, B2=Green, B3=Red.\nTry changing the contrast enhancement and see what happens, then consult GIS stack exchange to understand what is happening..\nOf course we have only used the 10m bands so far…there are two options that we can take to use the full range of spectral data:\n\nDownscale the other bands to 10m forming a super-resolution\nUpscale the 10m to 20m\n\nDown scaling is quite an intensive process and beyond the scope of this practical. However, it can be achieved using Sen2Res that is another plug in for the SNAP toolbox. Arguably SNAP is just a difference type of GIS software specific to Sentinel, but we will explore it later as it makes some of these concepts easier to understand.\nUpscaling aggregates the images to a more coarse resolution (e.g. 10m to 20m). The Sentinel user guide states that bands will be resampled and provided (e.g. within the 20m folder there are 10 bands). However, it’s not clear what method has been used, the documentation suggests nearest neighbour - https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/sentinel-2-l2a/.\nThis can also be termed resampling, and nearest neighbour simply means taking the new raster resolution and then assiging the value from the closest value in the original data. Others approaches include bilinear or cubic convolution resampling.\n\n1.1.1.2 SNAP\nSNAP stands for Sentinels Application Platform it is a collection of toolboxes specifically for pre-processing and analysing remotely sensed data.\nSNAP allows us to easily do undertake many GIS raster type analysis that we’ve seen / discussed in other modules (like CASA0005) and that we will come across within this module including:\n\nre sampling raster data\nre projecting\nmasking\nclassifying data\nprincipal component analysis\northorectification\nmany more methods!\n\nAside from these methods in a GUI the real benefit is that it’s made to use remotely sensed data. Let’s explore some features of SNAP.\n\n1.1.1.2.1 Load data\n\nFile > Open Product > select the .zip that was downloaded. Do not rename it or unzip it before hand!\nIn the side bar under Product Explorer there will be a lot on data that you can load. The remotely sensed data in under Bands and then each band is listed (e.g. B1 443nm). What does 443nm mean?\nDouble right click on a layer and it will appear in the viewer area\n\n1.1.1.2.2 SNAP layout\nThe layout of SNAP isn’t too different to QGIS, we have:\n\nProducts on the left side bar\nMap info in the bottom left\n\nadditional panes of info can be added through view >toolbar windows\nnote i have added pixel info (updates when moving the cursor) and world map\n\n\nLayer / mask managers in the right sidebar\nProcessing tools in the top tool bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, i have also the two link buttons selected (bottom left window) these mean that if i move to another band i will still be in the same position on the image.\n\n1.1.1.2.3 Colour composites\nTo re-created a true colour composite, right click on the data product and open RGB image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of other band combinations that we can use to show certain aspects of Earth’s surface based on the absorption and reflection properties of the materials in the wavelengths of the bands we display “through the colour guns”, for example:\n\nThe false colour composite: B8, B4, B3. Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red….\nAtmospheric penetration composite: B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.\nThe short-wave infrared composite: B12, B8A and B4 shows vegetation in green, the darker the greener the denser it is and brown shows built up or bare soil\n\nFor other band colour combinations consult gisgeogrpahy\n\n1.1.1.2.4 Image statistics\n\n1.1.1.2.4.1 Scatterplots\nUnder the analysis button there are a variety of tools we can use to explore some image statistics….for example, here i have created a scatter plot of band 4 (x axis) and band 8 ( y axis). These bands are the red (vegetation absorbs) and Near-infrared (NIR, that vegetation strongly reflects)…so where we have high values of NIR and low values of red the plot represents dense vegetation whilst low values of both red and NIR are usually wet bare soil:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://geofaculty.uwyo.edu/rhowell/classes/remote_sensing/labs/lab_11_2018_alternate_vegetation.pdf\n\n1.1.1.2.4.2 Tasseled Caps\nThe output should look somewhat like a “Tasseled Cap” (a wizards hat at an angle), although this is different to the tasseled cap transformation which was proposed by Kauth and Thomas (1976). The tasseled cap transformation was originally applied to Landsat data being composed of brightness, greeness, yellow stuff (yes!) and none-such. It was then modified in 1968 to brightness, greeness and wetness. This can can useful for identifying urban areas, they are usually bright (although Andy will have more to say on this), high biomass will show in the greeness and moisture in the wetness. The tasseled cap comes from the plot between brightness on the x axis and greenness on the y axis.\nTraditionally this is usually only applied to Landsat data, however if our bands in other sensors (like Sentinel) cover the same wavelengths we can apply it…\n\\[Brightness = 0.3037(B2)+0.2793(B3)+0.4743(B4)+0.5585(B8)+0.5082(B11)+0.1863(B12)\\] \\[Greeness = −0.2848(B2)−0.2435(B3)−0.5436(B4)+0.7243(B8)+0.0840(B11)−0.1800(B12)\\] \\[Wetness = 0.1509(B2)+0.1973(B3)+0.3279(B4)+0.3406(B8)−0.7112(B11)−0.4572(B12)\\]\nNow, this is fairly straight forward to do in SNAP (or R) using Band Maths (Raster > Band Maths) and then clicking edit expression, before we can apply this we have two problems:\n\nB11 and B12 are at a 20 meter resolution where as all the others at a 10 meter resolution, to fix this we must re-sample to 20m\nUsing the image provided will mean that the entire tile is computed when we really only care about our study area\n\nNote, that there are many spatial indexes that can be applied to remotely sensed data, the Index DataBase holds them all or Chapter 8, pages 325 from Jensen is a good place to start.\n\n1.1.1.2.5 Masking and resampling\nThis is sometimes also called clipping in CASA0005 we saw cropping (to the extent of a polygon) and then masking. Here I am only interested in a study area of the City of Cape Town District Municipality, which is in the gadm40_ZAF_2 GADM data, it also appears in the gadm40_ZAF_3 data too!\nExplore the GADM data in QGIS to work out what spatial aggregation you can use to mask your study area. For the sake of this example you might want to use the smallest spatial unit, GADM level 4, which for South Africa is wards.\nSNAP only permits ESRI shapefile to be loaded! To do so you must select the product on interest in the product explorer > Vector > Import > ESRI Shapefile\nWhen you open a Shapefile in SNAP each polygon within your current extent will be made into an individual feature, opening the feature (from the Vector Data folder) will open the attribute table for the row of that polygon.\nIn my case the City of Capetown has been called ZAF_2 and now i will clip the raster to the polygon through the Land/Sea Mask…from Raster > Masks\nHowever, the problem here is that we can only mask bands on the same spatial resolution, so we need to re sample bands 2,3,4 and 8 to 20m…here, we can use the Sentinel 2 resampling toolbox to resample the image.\nThere are two options to resample within SNAP, a traditional resample which just considers the neighbouring pixels or the Sentinel 2 products resample to account for the particularities of the angle (satellite viewing) bands. For the sake of time we will use the traditional resample to generate a 20m raster dataset…Raster > Geometric > Resampling…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there will be both upsampling and downsampling here as i’ve selected a 20m output.\nThis will create a new product in the product explorer so make sure you use that from now we, next we can mask out the all the bands we need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mask out our study area use the Land/Sea mask (Raster > Masks > Land/Sea mask) and select the vector to use as the mask. Here, i only take forward the bands i need:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen compute the tasseled cap transformation (Raster > Band Maths) with the equations above. Note that when using a subtraction (-) you might get invalid expression so use the inbuilt subtraction within the edit expression button.\nWe can now display the bands through the colour guns, R: Brightness, G: Greeness, B: Wetness and also create a scatter plot between Greeness (y) and Brightness (x) like we did earlier.\nAt this stage it is useful to also have open a true colour composite to compare to our tasseled cap transformation RBG image…what do the values and colours show?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Landsat\nWe have seen in CASA0005 how to access Landsat imagery. Now go and source some cloud free Landsat 8 Collection 1 level 2 imagery (surface reflectance data) for your city…\n\n1.1.2.1 Select POIs\n\n1.1.3 Spectral signatures\nhttps://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning#techniques\nhttps://urbanspatial.github.io/classifying_satellite_imagery_in_R/#Supervised_Classification\nhttps://opengislab.com/blog/2018/5/14/flood-mapping-with-sentinel-1-data-using-snap-and-qgis"
