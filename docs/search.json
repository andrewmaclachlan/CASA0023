This file tells git to ignore certain files so they aren’t in your local repository that is then pushed to GitHub. If you try and push large files to GitHub you will get an error and could run into lots of problems, trust me, i’ve been there. Look at my .gitignore for this repository and you will notice:\n/prac_1/*\nThis means ignore all files within these folders, all is denoted by the *. The .gitignore has to be in your main project folder, if you have made a a git repo for your project then you should have a .gitignore so all you have to do is open it and add the folder or file paths you wish to ignore.\nGitHub has a maximum file upload size of 50mb….\n\n\n\n\nGitHub maximum file upload of 50mb. Source: reddit r/ProgrammerHumor\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Sentinel download\n\nGo to the Copernicus Open Access Hub\n\nYou will need to make a free account\n\nDraw around the study area\nSelect image filter criteria\nSelect search icon\nDownload the S2MSI2A data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin this image we have:\n\nAllows you to either move around the global or draw a study area\nAn example of a study area\nHow to sort the image results\nSentinel mission selection :\n\n\nSentinel product types refer to the amount of processing that has been undertaken on the multi-spectral imagery. S2MSI2A = Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) or otherwise known as surface reflectance. Consult the product specification for more details.\n\nYou can also use the Sentinel 2 toolbox to replicate the conversation from TOA to BOA\n\nThe platform refers to either sentinel 2A or 2B. Theses are the same sensors but they operate at 180 degrees from each other reducing the revisit time from 10 to 5 days. 2A was launched first in 2015 followed by 2B in 2017.\nCloud cover e.g. [0 TO 5]\n\n_ Mu image was from the 15/5/2022\n\n1.2.1.1 Open\nOnce downloaded and unzipped you’ll be presented with a load of folders! Here we are interested in the 10m bands…which are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll find then in the GRANULE > sensor number > IMG_DATA > R10.\nNext open them up in QGIS for some exploration, if there is a TCI image this is a True Colour Image of B02 (Blue), B03 (Green), and B04 (Red) Bands - open this first, it’s just a single raster layer. See the Sentinel user guide definitions for any other acronyms you might need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Identify tool we can create a spectral signature by changing the view option to graph (look under the graph in the image above).\nHowever the TCI values are coded between 0 and 255 which will limit what we can do with it. As the the radiometric resolution of Sentinel-2 is 12-bit, meaning brightness levels from 0 - 4095 it’s not clear how this product has been made.\nSo we can make our own raster stack using the BOA bands, if you recall we did this in CASA0005 in R.\nBut in QGIS it’s easier to visualise the output\nFirst load the four 10M bands from the same folder e.g…T34HBH_20220515T081611_B02_10m\nFind the merge tool from the Raster miscellaneous tool box and select the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe input layers are the four 10m bands that I loaded into QGIS\nThe tick box selected meaning each raster file will be it’s own layer\nThe file being saved into a .tiff as opposed to memory\n\nOnce merged we can created a true colour composite using the BOA data…to do so:\n\nRight click on the merged layer in the attribute table\nSymbology > Render type > select multiband color\n\nIn remote sensing the Red, Green, Blue display options are often called colour guns that are used to display images on the screen. For a true colour composite B1=Blue, B2=Green, B3=Red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry changing the contrast enhancement and see what happens, then consult GIS stack exchange to understand what is happening..\nOf course we have only used the 10m bands so far…there are two options that we can take to use the full range of spectral data:\n\nDownscale the other bands to 10m forming a super-resolution\nUpscale the 10m to 20m\n\nDown scaling is quite an intensive process and beyond the scope of this practical. However, it can be achieved using Sen2Res that is another plug in for the SNAP toolbox. Arguably SNAP is just a difference type of GIS software specific to Sentinel, but we will explore it later as it makes some of these concepts easier to understand.\nUpscaling aggregates the images to a more coarse resolution (e.g. 10m to 20m). The Sentinel user guide states that bands will be resampled and provided (e.g. within the 20m folder there are 10 bands). However, it’s not clear what method has been used, the documentation suggests nearest neighbour - https://docs.sentinel-hub.com/api/latest/data/sentinel-2-l2a/.\nThis can also be termed resampling, and nearest neighbour simply means taking the new raster resolution and then assiging the value from the closest value in the original data. Others approaches include bilinear or cubic convolution resampling.\n\n1.2.1.2 SNAP\nSNAP stands for Sentinels Application Platform it is a collection of toolboxes specifically for pre-processing and analysing remotely sensed data.\nDownload the all toolboxes version\nSNAP allows us to easily do undertake many GIS raster type analysis that we’ve seen / discussed in other modules (like CASA0005) and that we will come across within this module including:\n\nre sampling raster data\nre projecting\nmasking\nclassifying data\nprincipal component analysis\northorectification\nmany more methods!\n\nAside from these methods in a GUI the real benefit is that it’s made to use remotely sensed data. Let’s explore some features of SNAP.\n\n1.2.1.2.1 Load data\n\nFile > Open Product > select the .zip that was downloaded. Do not rename it or unzip it before hand!\nIn the side bar under Product Explorer there will be a lot on data that you can load. The remotely sensed data in under Bands and then each band is listed (e.g. B1 443nm). What does 443nm mean?\nDouble right click on a layer and it will appear in the viewer area\n\n1.2.1.2.2 SNAP layout\nThe layout of SNAP isn’t too different to QGIS, we have:\n\nProducts on the left side bar\nMap info in the bottom left\n\nadditional panes of info can be added through view >toolbar windows\nnote i have added pixel info (updates when moving the cursor) and world map\n\n\nLayer / mask managers in the right sidebar\nProcessing tools in the top tool bars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, i have also the two link buttons selected (bottom left window) these mean that if i move to another band i will still be in the same position on the image.\n\n1.2.1.2.3 Colour composites\nTo re-created a true colour composite, right click on the data product and open RGB image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a variety of other band combinations that we can use to show certain aspects of Earth’s surface based on the absorption and reflection properties of the materials in the wavelengths of the bands we display “through the colour guns”, for example:\n\nThe false colour composite: B8, B4, B3. Plants reflect near-infrared and green light whilst absorbing red….\nAtmospheric penetration composite: B12, B11, B8A with no visible bands to penetrate atmospheric particles. Vegetation = blue, urban area = white, gray cyan or purple.\nThe short-wave infrared composite: B12, B8A and B4 shows vegetation in green, the darker the greener the denser it is and brown shows built up or bare soil\n\nFor other band colour combinations consult gisgeogrpahy\n\n1.2.1.2.4 Creating a project\nBefore we go any further we should create a project, that way all our processed outputs will be stored within the projected and loaded again when we open it in future - like projects in any other software such as QGIS or R. Go File > Project > Save project. A project tab next to the product explorer tab will appear, but not you can’t access the bands from within the project that must be done through the product explorer.\n\n1.2.1.2.5 Image statistics\n\n1.2.1.2.6 Image histogram\nWhen we open an RGB image in SNAP the histogram is clipped by 1% at the lower end and 4% at the upper end and then mapped in bins between 0 and 255 for display. A computer screen in full RGB displays colours between 0 and 255, hence why this is done.\nThis is similar to the contrast enhancement we saw in QGIS and we can manually change it here again through View > Tool Windows > Colour Manipulation.\nChanging the distribution displayed will impact the colour of the image - try using the sliders or selecting 95% and 100% of all pixels to display. To reset click the back arrow button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1.2.6.1 Scatterplots\nUnder the analysis button there are a variety of tools we can use to explore some image statistics….for example, here i have created a scatter plot of band 4 (x axis) and band 8 ( y axis). These bands are the red (vegetation absorbs) and Near-infrared (NIR, that vegetation strongly reflects)…so where we have high values of NIR and low values of red the plot represents dense vegetation whilst low values of both red and NIR are usually wet bare soil. you need to click the refresh button to generate the plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Remote Sensing 4113\n\n\n\n\nIn remote sensing this can be called “spectral feature space”, more on this later in the term. You might see the software ENVI in the source above - ENVI is propriety software that is similar to SNAP.\n\n1.2.1.2.6.2 Tasseled Caps\nThe output should look somewhat like a “Tasseled Cap” (a wizards hat at an angle), although this is different to the tasseled cap transformation which was proposed by Kauth and Thomas (1976). The tasseled cap transformation was originally applied to Landsat data being composed of brightness, greeness, yellow stuff (yes!) and none-such. It was then modified in 1968 to brightness, greeness and wetness. This can can useful for identifying urban areas, they are usually bright (although Andy will have more to say on this), high biomass will show in the greeness and moisture in the wetness. The tasseled cap comes from the plot between brightness on the x axis and greenness on the y axis.\nTraditionally this is usually only applied to Landsat data, however if our bands in other sensors (like Sentinel) cover the same wavelengths we can apply it…\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nBrightness = 0.3037(B2)+0.2793(B3)+\\\\0.4743(B4)+0.5585(B8)+\\\\\n0.5082(B11)+0.1863(B12)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nGreeness = −0.2848(B2)−0.2435(B3)\\\\−0.5436(B4)+0.7243(B8)+\\\\\n0.0840(B11)−0.1800(B12)\\end{split}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nWetness = 0.1509(B2)+0.1973(B3)\\\\+0.3279(B4)+0.3406(B8)\\\\−\n0.7112(B11)−0.4572(B12)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nNow, this is fairly straight forward to do in SNAP (or R) using Band Maths (Raster > Band Maths) and then clicking edit expression, before we can apply this we have two problems:\n\nB11 and B12 are at a 20 meter resolution where as all the others at a 10 meter resolution, to fix this we must re-sample to 20m\nUsing the image provided will mean that the entire tile is computed when we really only care about our study area\n\nNote, that there are many spatial indexes that can be applied to remotely sensed data, the Index DataBase holds them all or Chapter 8, pages 325 from Jensen is a good place to start.\n\n1.2.1.2.7 Masking and resampling\nThis is sometimes also called clipping in CASA0005 we saw cropping (to the extent of a polygon) and then masking. Here I am only interested in a study area of the City of Cape Town District Municipality, which is in the gadm40_ZAF_2 from the GADM data, it also appears in the gadm40_ZAF_3 data too!\nExplore the GADM data in QGIS to work out what spatial aggregation you can use to mask your study area. For the sake of this example you might want to use the smallest spatial unit, GADM level 4, which for South Africa is wards.\nSNAP only permits ESRI shapefile to be loaded! To do so you must select the product on interest in the product explorer > Vector > Import > ESRI Shapefile\nWhen you load the vector file it will appear under the image product that you had selected. To show it on the map, move to the right of the screen > select layer manager > check the layer you want to show.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you open a Shapefile in SNAP each polygon within your current extent will be made into an individual feature, opening the feature (from the Vector Data folder) will open the attribute table for the row of that polygon. You also might notice that the shapefile may have a larger extent than the image, this means we’d need to find another image and “mosaic” (merge or join together) them but we will see this later in the module, for now just accept that some area might be missing.\nIn my case the City of Capetown has been called ZAF_1 and now i will clip the raster to the polygon. However, the problem here is that we can only mask bands on the same spatial resolution, so we need to re sample bands 2,3,4 and 8 to 20m…here, we can use the Sentinel 2 resampling toolbox to resample the image and then move to masking it.\nThere are two options to resample within SNAP, a traditional resample which just considers the neighbouring pixels or the Sentinel 2 products resample to account for the particularities of the angle (satellite viewing) bands. For the sake of time we will use the traditional resample to generate a 20m raster dataset…Raster > Geometric > Resampling…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there will be both upsampling and downsampling here as i’ve selected a 20m output.\nThis will create a new product in the product explorer so make sure you use that from now we, next we can mask out the all the bands we need:\nTo mask out our study area use the Land/Sea mask (Raster > Masks > Land/Sea mask) and select the vector to use as the mask. Here, i only take forward the bands i need (scroll up to check):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage you may want to remove the shapefile that will still be within the new product created. Under the vector folder remove the relevant polygons.\nThen compute the tasseled cap transformation (Raster > Band Maths) with the equations above. Note that when using a subtraction (-) you might get invalid expression so use the inbuilt subtraction within the edit expression button. My brightness equation was:\n\n(0.3037* $3.B2) + (0.2793 * $3.B3) + (0.4743 * $3.B4) + (0.5585 * $3.B8) + (0.5082 * 0.5082) + (0.1863 * 0.1863)\n\nThe new layers we’ve created will be added to the bands folder of the product you had selected (remember that we can only do this with bands that have the same resolution, hence our up and down sampling). We can now display the bands through the colour guns, R: Brightness, G: Greeness, B: Wetness and also create a scatter plot between Greeness (y) and Brightness (x) like we did earlier.\nAt this stage it is useful to also have open a true colour composite to compare to our tasseled cap transformation RBG image…what do the values and colours show? The Tasseled Cap function from ArcPro will help explain this further.\n\n\n?(caption)\n\n\n\n\n\nin the caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Landsat\nLandsat imagery is the longest free temporal image repository of consistent medium resolution data. It collects data at each point on Earth each every 16 days (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of 30 by 30 m cells (spatial resolution). Geographical analysis and concepts are becoming ever more entwined with remote sensing and Earth observation.\nTo access the Landsat data we will use in this practical you can need to sign up for a free account at: https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.\nTo download the data:\n\nEnter your city in the address/place box > select the country > click Show and then click on the word of your city in the box that appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce downloaded unzip the file.\nIn SNAP go File > Open Product, navigate to the .MTL and open it. The product should appear. This is a real benefit of SNAP, having data from multiple sensors in the same software that can be explored together - when you move around on the Landsat image then the Sentinel image will also move to the same location.\nTo see the bands (or RGB images) side by side use the window dividers in the top right and also ensure the views are linked in the bottom left window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next part of the practical we will compare the spectral signatures from both Sentinel and Landsat. To do so we need to generate a series of points of interest (called POIs) that are coincident in both images. First we need to do two things:\n\nClip all the spectral data from the Sentinel image to the vector outline\n\nwe will need to resample the Sentinel data to the same pixel size so consider what you want to do here\n\nupscale or downscale ?\nWhat bands over Sentinel and Landsat actually overlap, do you need all of them\n\nwhat resolution is useful\n\n\n\n\nClip the Landsat image to the same vector outline as the Sentinel image, during the mask you can select the bands to mask and output\n\nOnce you have completed these steps you output should look something like this, however, note that my Landsat tile is a different extent to my Sentinel tile, we cover this later in the module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2.1 Select POIs\n\nTo create points of interest we want select pixels representative of certain land cover types (e.g. Bare earth, water, grass, forest, urban) so we can compare them from both Landsat and Sentinel. Of course the pixels need to be present in both datasets.\nWe can select pixels through QGIS, R or SNAP. I’ll focus on the latter here.\nMake a new vector data container for a land cover type (Vector > New Vector Data Container). Note that it will be created within the data product that is selected. Next click the square icon with a plus to add vectors. Once finished repeat the process of adding a new vector data container for the next land cover type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext use a drawing tool to draw around areas of land cover, when you select the drawing tool you will be asked which landcover the polygon is for, make sure the area is in both imagery - switch between them as we have done or display them side by side. Whilst doing this it is useful to have the spectrum view open (View > Tool Windows > Optical >Spectrum Viewer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce done create another vector data container and repeat for the next land cover type.\nConsider have a separate class for highly reflective urban (e.g. industrial areas)\n\n1.2.3 Spectral signatures\nTo compare out spectral signatures we have a few options\n\nright click on the image in SNAP and then export mask pixels as a .txt, but you will need to do this for each land cover class and for each image (Sentinel and Landsat).\n\nor\n\nexport the imagery (to Geotiff) and vector files (to shapefiles) and then subset in R\n\nI will do the second option here:\n\nRight clicking on the vector containers will allow export to shapefile - do this for all the land covers you have\nTo export the “product” which is what your image will be un SNAP. Select it (just click it) then go File > Export > GeoTIFF. When exporting the Landsat data click the subset button in the save box > band subset (select only spectral bands) and then metadata subset and remove all the selection.\nOpen the GeoTIFFS and shapefiles in QGIS to check everything.This is another good opportunity to understand how contrast enhancement works - in QGIS > Symbology > expand min / max and then change the cumulative count cut the value for each band will change. For Landsat B3 is red, B2 is green and B1 is blue. This does not change the values of the pixels, just how they are displayed on a colour screen.\n\n1.2.4 Using R\nRemember that before we deal with large data sets in R, we must sort out the .gitignore file, if we intend to use Git and GitHub at any stage (hint: you will for the assessment). Go back to CASA0005 to remember how if you need to\nRaster packages in R have and are still evolving rapidly, we have probably seen and used the raster package and may have seen the terra or stars packages. All can handle raster data and do the same analysis (pretty much).\nIn 2023 some key packages will retire like maptools, rgdal and rgeos as their maintainer, Roger Bivand will retire. raster uses sp objects for vector data and also the rgdal package - the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) for reading, writing and converting between spatial formats. sp (that we saw in CASA0005) also uses rgdal and suggests rgeos.\nThe terra package (2020) is somewhat mixed with raster, however the retiring packages are only needed by raster, with the terra package replacing raster. Terra is much faster than raster as datasets that can’t be loaded into RAM are stored on disc and when loaded doesn’t read the values. Then when computations occur the do so in chunks. Terra is very well documented and the functions are very similar to raster - https://rspatial.org/terra/pkg/index.html\nThe stars package (2018) works with sf!!, this means many of the functions we’ve seen and are familiar with it will work - e.g. st_transform() which is much easier than doing it in raster. The real benefit of stars is its ability to handle large data (like satellite data) that can’t fit into memory. It does this through not loading the pixel values but keeping a reference to them through a proxy and only loading / running computations when specifically needed (e.g. plotting, will only plot the pixels that can be seen)! The stars section from Spatial Data Science in Pebesma and Bivnad 2022 gives a good overview with examples\nStars is faster than terra, terra is faster than raster.\n\n1.2.4.1 Data loading\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n\nbare_earth <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Bare_earth_Polygon.shp\")\ngrass <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Grass_Polygon.shp\")\nforest <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Forest_Polygon.shp\")\nurban <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Low_urban_Polygon.shp\")\nhigh_urban <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/High_urban_Polygon.shp\")\n\n\n#Landsat equivalent\nbands <- c(\"1\",\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\")\n\nsentinel <- rast(\"prac_1/Data/S2A_LSAT_msk.tif\")\n\nnames(sentinel) <- bands\n  \nlandsat<-rast(\"prac_1/Data/LSAT_msk.tif\")\n\nnames(landsat) <- bands\n\nHere i have chosen to use terra, this is because i want to extract the pixel values from within the polygons and at the moment stars will only permit aggregation - e.g. the mean of the pixels in the polygons. This is fine unless you want to explore the variation in signatures! then you will need the values.\nTo use a vector layer in terra it needs to be in a SpatVector (in terra the raster is a SpatRaster). Now there are two ways we can do this…the first is with the vect() function from terra:\n\nurban <- vect(urban)\n\nIn the second we can actually convert the SpatRaster to a raster and then just use the sf object! I know, i know, how many formats do we need here! But this will mean we have a raster brick as we have all of our bands and a raster brick won’t work here.\n\nlandsat <- as(landsat, \"Raster\")\n\nOf course, we can just do this straight from loading the data with the pipe…\n\nbare_earth <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Bare_earth_Polygon.shp\") %>%\n  vect()\ngrass <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Grass_Polygon.shp\")%>%\n    vect()\nforest <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Forest_Polygon.shp\")%>%\n    vect()\nurban <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/Low_urban_Polygon.shp\")%>%\n    vect()\nhigh_urban <- st_read(\"prac_1/Data/High_urban_Polygon.shp\")%>%\n    vect()\n\nBefore we can start the extraction you might have seen that my Landsat data is not in the same CRS as the rest of the data, it’s close, but different. We can also just use the raster to get the CRS info, like\n\ncrs(landsat)\ncrs(sentinel)\n\n# reproject landsat\nlandsat <- project(landsat, sentinel)\n\nNow let’s pull out those values, and get the mean and standard deviation, starting with urban from sentinel data…\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsen_urban<- terra::extract(sentinel, urban, progress = F)%>%\n  as_tibble()%>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = 2:7, \n               names_to=\"bands\", \n               values_to=\"band_values\")%>%\n  add_column(sensor=\"sentinel\")%>%\n  add_column(land=\"urban\")\n\nNow, because this process will be the same for the other landcover types we can make a function…this is the exact same code as above but i’ve replaced two arguments with sensor and lancover that i can now change for each version (e.g. bare earth in Landsat or forest in Sentinel)\n\nband_fun <- function(sensor, landcover) {\n  col_sensor <- deparse(substitute(sensor))\n  col_land <- deparse(substitute(landcover))\n\n  sen_urban<- terra::extract(sensor, landcover, progress = F)%>%\n    as_tibble()%>%\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:7, \n               names_to=\"bands\", \n               values_to=\"band_values\")%>%\n    add_column(sensor=col_sensor)%>%\n    add_column(land=col_land)\n                 \n}\n\nLater on we will also create a density plot, so let’s write a function for all the values…it’s very similar…we will call this one when we need it later…\n\nband_fun_all_values <- function(sensor, landcover) {\n  col_sensor <- deparse(substitute(sensor))\n  col_land <- deparse(substitute(landcover))\n\n  sen_urban<- terra::extract(sensor, landcover, progress = F)%>%\n    as_tibble()%>%\n    pivot_longer(cols = 2:7, \n               names_to=\"bands\", \n               values_to=\"band_values\")\n                 \n}\n\nThen it’s simply…\n\nsen_bare <- band_fun(sentinel, bare_earth)\nsen_grass<- band_fun(sentinel, grass) \nsen_forest<- band_fun(sentinel, forest) \nsen_high_urban <- band_fun(sentinel, high_urban) \n\nlsat_urban<- band_fun(landsat, urban)\nlsat_bare<- band_fun(landsat, bare_earth)\nlsat_grass<- band_fun(landsat, grass)\nlsat_forest<- band_fun(landsat, forest)\nlsat_high_urban <- band_fun(sentinel, high_urban) \n\nThink about what this has given us?\nThe next stage is to put then into a tibble…\n\nsen_lsat <- bind_rows(sen_urban, sen_bare, sen_grass,\n                      sen_forest, sen_high_urban,\n                      lsat_urban, lsat_bare, lsat_grass,\n                      lsat_forest, lsat_high_urban)\n\nThe next stage is to get the mean (and standard deviation) values for each band per sensor and land cover type:\n\nmeans<- sen_lsat%>%\n  group_by(bands, sensor, land)%>%\n  summarise(Mean=mean(band_values), Std=sd(band_values))\n\nPlot some spectral profiles, first for Sentinel…\n\np1 <- means %>%\n  filter(sensor==\"sentinel\") %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = bands, y = Mean,\n                col=land))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_line(aes(group = land)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = (Mean-Std), ymax = (Mean+Std), width = 0.2))\np1\n\n\n\n\nWe can also look at a density plot….ideally each land cover has a clear and separate historgram…\n\np2 <- sen_lsat %>%\n  filter(sensor==\"sentinel\") %>%\nggplot(., aes(x=band_values, group=land, fill=land)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6)+\n#Add a mean vertical line\n  geom_vline(data = . %>% group_by(land) %>% summarise(group_mean = mean(band_values)),\n             aes(xintercept=group_mean, color = land), linetype=\"dashed\", size=1)\n\np2\n\n\n\nThanks to Sydney Goldstein for some of this code\n\n\n\n\nRemember this mean vertical line is for all values per land cover, it’s not band specific.\nAndy will talk about these outputs.\nWe can arrange our grids nicely with the cowplot package…\n\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\noutput<-plot_grid(p1, p2, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12, ncol=1)\n\noutput\n\n\n\n\nWe can also export this if we wanted with ggsave() to,ggsave has a lot of options and can output to most formats, it also gives examples of not using ggsave\n\nggsave(\"spectral_reflectance.pdf\", width = 20, height = 20, units = \"cm\")\n\nHere, i have just shown the process for Sentinel data.

    "text": "As described in the lecture, a rather simple method to correct raw satellite (or any other) imagery is called Dark Object Subtraction (DOS). This uses the logic that the darkest pixel within the image should be 0 and therefore any value that it has can be attributed to the atmosphere.\nSo in order to remove the effect of the atmosphere we can the subtract the value from the rest of the pixels within the image.\nHere, we will need to download some raw satellite imagery, that is in Digital Number (DN).\nThen we will apply the formula to calculate the reluctance of the pixels by removing atmosphere effects.The formula for the cosine of the solar zenith angle correction (COST) is, this is the same as DOS but DOS omits TAUz. The following has made use of the documentation from GIS Ag Maps.com\n\\[\\rho_{\\lambda}= \\frac{(Lsat_{rad} - Lhaze1percent_{rad})\\pi * d^2}{EO_{\\lambda} * cos\\theta S * TUAv + TAUz}\\]\nWhere…\n\n\n\\(\\rho_{\\lambda}\\) is the corrected value (DOS applied)\n\nTop line of equation…\n\n\\(Lsat_{rad}\\) = at sensor radiance (recall DN goes to radiance through the regression equation we saw!)\n\n\\(Lhaze1percent_{rad}\\) = amount of radiance that is due to the atmosphere (atmospheric haze) from path or scatter radiance. Very few surfaces are completely black so it is assume that the darkest surface has a 1% reflectance. Various methods to caclcualte this…\n\nLook up tables\nSelecting the darkest pixels (shadow, water)\n\n\n\nWhen we have the haze amount then deduct 1% from that value per band as few targets are absolutely black.\nFor COST this this:\n\\[ 0.01 reflectance = 0.01 *\\frac{Eoλ * cosθs^2} {d² * pi}\\]\nFor DOS it’s\n\\[ 0.01 reflectance = 0.01 *\\frac{Eoλ * cosθs} {d² * pi}\\]\n\n\n\\(EO_{\\lambda}\\) or \\(ESUN_{\\lambda}\\) = mean exoatmospheric irradiance\n\nirradiance = power per unit area received from the Sun\nexoatmospheric = just outside the Earth’s atmosphere\nThese values are available from the Landsat user manual such as table 5.3 in the Landsat 7 user guide\n\n\n\n\\(cosθs\\) = cosine of the solar azimuth, remember from the lecture that this is 90 - solar elevation.\n\\(d\\) = the Earth-sun distance and is in the .MTL file\n\\(pi\\) = 3.14159265\n\nOnce we have all these values then we can do the following:\n\nCompute the haze value for each band (although not beyond NIR) - this is the amount of radiance that is due to the atmosphere (atmospheric haze), see above methods.\nConvert DN to radiance\nCompute the 1% reflectance value using the equations above\nSubtract the 1% reflectance value from the radiance. Here we are saying that we have a pixel (e.g. darkest pixel), we know what 1% of the total radiance is and we are subtracting that from the darkest pixel (which still has atmospheric effects) to account for most targets not being completely black.\n\nWe can now plug the values in:\n\\[\\rho_{\\lambda}= \\frac{(Lsat_{rad} - Lhaze1percent_{rad})\\pi * d^2}{EO_{\\lambda} * cos\\theta S * TUAv + TAUz}\\]\nWhere the \\(Lhaze1percent_{rad}\\) is the haze value (e.g. darkest pixel) minus 1% of the total radiance. This 1% was computed from the equations above.\nWithin this equation:\n\\(TAUv\\) = 1.0 for Landsat and \\(TAUz\\) = cosθs for COST method. DOS is the same, but without \\(TAUz\\)\nOf course we can do this in R (or any other software) with just one function! First we need to download some raw satellite data that comes in the Digital Number (DN) format. This is the exact same process as we saw in week 1, expect this time select the Collection 1, Level-1 bundle. At the moment this process won’t work with Landsat 9. However, as this involves a large amount of data and it’s unlikely you will need to do this in the module of data read through the following code and then move to the next section\n\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(raster)\nlibrary(RStoolbox)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(rgdal)\n\n## Import meta-data and bands based on MTL file\nmtlFile  <- (\"prac_3/Lsatdata8/LC08_L1TP_175083_20211005_20211013_01_T1_MTL.txt\")\n                        \nmetaData <- readMeta(mtlFile)\n\nlsatMeta  <- stackMeta(metaData)\n\n# surface reflectance with DOS\n\nl8_boa_ref <- radCor(lsatMeta, metaData, method = \"dos\")\n\n#terra::writeRaster(l8_boa_ref, datatype=\"FLT4S\", filename = \"prac_3/Lsatdata8/l8_boa_ref.tif\", format = \"GTiff\", overwrite=TRUE)\n\n# Radiance \n\nlsat_rad <- radCor(lsatMeta, metaData = metaData, method = \"rad\")\n\n#terra::writeRaster(lsat_rad, datatype=\"FLT4S\", filename = \"prac_3/Lsatdata8/lsat_rad.tif\", format = \"GTiff\", overwrite=TRUE)\n\n\nhazeDN    <- RStoolbox::estimateHaze(lsat, hazeBands = 2:4, darkProp = 0.01, plot = TRUE)\n\nlsat_sref <- radCor(lsatMeta, metaData = metaData, method = \"dos\", \n                    hazeValues = hazeDN, hazeBands = 2:4)\n\nhttps://rpubs.com/delViento/atm_corr\n\nAs noted in the lecture there are a wide range of more sophisticated methods (beyond Dark Object Subtraction) to convert raw Digital Numbers or radiance to surface reflectance.\nWhilst this is a bit beyond the scope of this module, if you look again at the Landsat 7 Data Users Handbook you will see a radiance to reflectance calculation that can be used…“For relatively clear Landsat scenes”:\n\\[\\rho_{\\rho}= \\frac{\\pi* L_{\\lambda} * d ^2}{ESUN_{\\lambda} * cos\\theta_S}\\]\nand…we’ve seen all these values in the DOS formula, except \\(\\rho_{\\rho}\\) which is Unitless planetary reflectance\n…this method is still used in current research too, for example it’s listed in this paper of Land Surface Temperature retrieval by Sekertekin and Bonafonu, 2020. See Appendix C for Landsat 5, 7 (that use the above equation) and Landsat 8, that uses this slight variation…\n\\[\\rho_{\\rho}= \\frac{M_{p}* Q_{CAL} + A_p}{sin\\theta_{SE}}\\]\nWhere…\n\n\\(M_p\\) is the band-specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata\n\\(A_p\\) is the band-specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata\n\\(QCAL\\) is the digital number\n\\(\\theta_{SE}\\) is the sun elevation angle from the metadata file.\n\nAlthough it’s worth noting that this is Top of Atmosphere reflectance (TOA).\nRadiance is how much light the sensor sees.\nReflectance is the ratio of light leaving the target to amount striking the target. Here will still have atmopsheric effects in the way of our true apparent reflectance. Confusingly all of these can be termed reflectance and indeed sometimes radiance is referred to as reflectance.\nTOA reflectance changes the data from what the sensor sees to the ratio of light leaving compared to striking it. BUT, the atmosphere is still present. If we remove the atmopshere we have apparent reflectance (sometimes called Bottom of Atmosphere reflectance). DOS gives us a version of apparent reflectance."

We must select two images are mosaic (or merge) them together. Landsat data (and most satellite data) is collected using some form of Worldwide Reference System. This splits the data based on PATH (columns) and ROWS.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Samuel Akande\n\n\n\n\nBefore we start with merging we need to download two satellite tiles to merge together. The problem is that Landsat tiles won’t align with administration boundraies (or they might if you are lucky). For my example city of Cape Town i need at least two, possible three Landsat tiles to be merged together. In USGS Earth Explorer you can upload a shapefile or KML so you can search for tiles to cover the area. However, this is rather slow and the shapefile must only contain one polygon (cape town includes an island too). You can, however, draw a boundary to search within:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my example i am going to select two tiles, i know which two to select from looking at the GADM boundary for Cape Town.\nWhen doing this:\n\nSelect two images as temporally close to each other as possible\nTry and make sure there is no (or very little cloud cover)\nIn this case select Landsat Collection 2 level 2 to get surface reflectance.\n\nNotes on Landsat Collections. The different collections denote a major difference in processing of the data. Where as the levels denote a specific product. There is no clear guide online that explains this, so be careful when reading papers!\nFor example…\n\nA primary characteristic of Collection 2 is the substantial improvement in the absolute geolocation accuracy of the global ground reference dataset used in the Landsat Level-1 processing flow\n\nCollection 2 was released in 2020 and has some updates, see this summary of differences for collection 1 vs collection 2. The collection 2 auxiliary data can also be downloaded from Earth Explorer.\nWhereas levels will provide:\n\nLevel 1 is delivered as a Digital Number\nLevel 2 includes surface reflectance and surface temperature\nLevel 3 science products are specific products generated from the data such as Burned Area, surface water extent\nMost of the level datasets are tiered, this is denoted through the file name that might end with T1. Tiers are based on data quality and level of processing. Tier 1 datasets are the best quality, tier 2 are good but might have some cloud that affects radiometric calibration covering ground control points.\nThere is also a U.S. Analysis Read Dataset (ARD) that includes a bundle of data (Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, TOA Brightness Temperature, Surface Reflectance , Surface Temperature and Quality Assessment) in a specific US grid strucutre. This removes the need to process data between the difference stages for applications in the US.\n\nTo conclude, we have collections, followed by levels, followed by tiers.\n\n\n\n\nSource: USGS\n\n\n\n\nIn this case I want to download two tiles from Collection 2, Level 2. You can view the tiles and preview the data in Earth Explorer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the options below each tile icon in the search results you can either download the tiles individually or add them to a basked (it’s the box icon). After clicking the box on the products you want to download > click the basket (top right) > you will then be presented with this screen where you click start order and then follow the prompts to download multiple tiles at once."

    "text": "3.4 Enhancements\nUsing our merged Landsat data we can now undertake some basic enhancements to try and emphasize / exaggerate certain features or spectral traits.\n\n3.4.1 Ratio\nRatioing is the difference between two spectral bands that have a certain spectral response meaning it is easier to identify a certain landscape feature…for example…\n\nThe Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is based on the fact that healthy and green vegetation reflects more in the NIR but absorbs in the Red wavelength\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: PhysicsOpenLab\n\n\n\n\nHere, we can visually see the spectral trait:\n\n\n\n\nSource: PhysicsOpenLab\n\n\n\n\nWe can leverage the fact that healthy vegetation has this spectral trait and use the NDVI index should we wish to highlight areas with healthy vegetation.\n\\[NDVI= \\frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red}\\]\nIn R this would be:\n\nm1_NDVI <- (m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B5 - m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B4 ) / (m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B5 + m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B4)\n\nm1_NDVI %>%\n  plot(.)\n\nWe can reclassify this to pull out certain areas, for example, only where NDVI is equal to or greater than 0.2\n\nveg <- m1_NDVI %>%\n  terra::classify(., cbind(-Inf, 0.2, NA))\n\nveg %>%\n  plot(.)\n\n\n\n\nThere are many other ratios, all of which are detailed on the Index Database and most follow the same formula. For example, the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI):\nFor Landsat sensors 4-7:\n\\[NDMI= \\frac{Band 4-Band 5}{Band 4 + Band 5}\\]\nFor Landsat 8, bands are increased by 1.\n\n3.4.2 Filtering\nFiltering refers to any kind of moving window operation to our data which can be saved as a separate raster file. As we saw in the lecture this can include low or high pass filters.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Introduction to Geographic Information Systems in Forest Resources\n\n\n\n\n\n# for a 3 by 3 filter on 1 band\nm1_filter <- terra::focal(m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B4, w=matrix(1/9,nrow=3,ncol=3))\n\n\n3.4.3 Texture\nThe basics of texture were covered in the lecture. To apply texture analysis to data in R, we can use the glcm package which has a selection of eight texture measures, and we can apply these per band…for example…Note, to use this you must have RTools installed as it makes use of the C++ language.\nBelow we can specify:\n\nthe size of the moving window\nthe shift for co-occurrency (or second order) as seen in the lecture. If multiple shifts are supplied, glcm will calculate each texture statistic using all the specified shifts and return the mean value of the texture for each pixel\nthe measures we want, for full equations see Texture Metrics Background%20of%20the%20occurrence%20values.&text=It%20normalizes%20the%20occurrence%20values,(9%20in%20this%20example).)\n\nNote, that we commonly don’t use the pancrhomatic band in landcover classification, however as it is 15m it can produce some useful outputs.\nCurrently the glcm package only accepts raster layers from the raster package so we first need to convert this to a raster layer…this will take 7-10 minutes…increasing the window size and selecting less statistics should speed this up.\n\nlibrary(glcm)\nlibrary(raster)\n\nband4_raster<-raster::raster(m1$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B4)\n\nglcm <- glcm(band4_raster,\n                   window = c(7, 7),\n                   #shift=list(c(0,1), c(1,1), c(1,0), c(1,-1)), \n                   statistics = c(\"homogeneity\"))\n\nglcm$glcm_homogeneity %>%\n  plot(.)\n\nDepending on your study area the texture measures might not show much, but in this example from Lu et al. 2012 what does it highlight or make more prominent.\n\n\n\n\nSource: Land use/cover classification in the Brazilian Amazon using satellite images\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Data fusion\nIn the simplest form data fusion is appending new raster data to the existing data or making a new raster dataset with different bands…here we can do this with the texture measure we have created (and the original spectral data if you wish). We are getting to the stage now where remote sensing is a merge of science and art. Specifically the science is how we correct and apply methods, the art is about how we select the right data / transform it / alter it to produce an output. There is never a completely right answer as we will see in future practicals.\nTo create decision level fusion we append our new datasets to our existing data…\n\n# for the next step of PCA we need to keep this in a raster (and not terra) format...\nm1_raster <- stack(m1)\n\nFuse <- stack(m1_raster, glcm.red)\n\nRecall from the lecture there is also object fusion and image fusion.\n\n3.4.5 PCA\nPrincipal Component Analysis is designed to reduce the dimensionality of our data. In this case we might want to scale our data, meaning that we can compare data that isn’t measured in the same way (as we have spectral and texture data). To do so we can use the function scale, that by default standarize the data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. If we just wanted to subtract the mean we could set scale=FALSE as an argument.\nWhen we use rasterPCA() we can set the number of samples nsamples to be used for PCA which are then applied to the rest of the data to try and make this more efficient…\nAlso note that spca=TRUE which corresponds to centered and scaled input data\n\nlibrary(RStoolbox)\n\nFuse_3_bands <- stack(Fuse$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B4, Fuse$LC08_L2SP_175083_20220501_20220504_02_T1_SR_B5, Fuse$glcm_homogeneity)\n\nscale_fuse<-scale(Fuse_3_bands)\n\npca <- rasterPCA(Fuse, \n                 nSamples =100,\n                 spca = TRUE)\n\nOnce the rasterPCA() has completed run the following code to get the proportion of variance explained by each PCA component and the cumulative proportion of the variance explained. Remember that PCA is trying to:\n\nTransform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset\nKeep most of the original information\nThe first component will (should) capture most of the variance within the dataset\n\n\nsummary(pca$model)\n\nIn my case component 1 (of 10) explains 77.62% of the variance from the entire dataset…how might this be useful in future analysis?\nFinally, to plot one of the PCA bands….\n\nplot(pca$map$PC1)\n\n\n3.4.6 Review questions\nFor the task this week select one concept from the lecture to explore in greater detail (e.g. texture analysis to remotely sensed images).\nWrite 2-3 paragraphs supporting your responses with plots and literature:\n\nExplain the concept (e.g. what texture analysis is)\nDetail how it has been applied in 2 studies\nReflect on the applicability / usefulness\n\n3.4.7 Useful blogs\n\nTexture and PCA in R"

If you search the data catalog for sentinel there will be a wide variety to select from, here i have gone for surface reflectance and the harmonized product that shifts newer images to be the same as that in older images, creating a consistent collection!\nThere is code provided for us to load us on the Harmonized Sentinel-2 MSI: MultiSpectral Instrument Level-2A catalog page\nLooking at this code you will see there is a cloud mask. There are two options we have when dealing with clouds.\n\nTo filter the entire collection based on a low cloud coverage percentage per tile, like we did last week\nTo set a higher percentage per tile (e.g. 20) but then to use the quality assurance (QA) bands to filter the clouds per pixel. Scrolling down the bands list on the catalog page there is a description of the bitmask for the relevant QA band (QA60). Here we can see the value for each pixel. This is the same layer that we get when downloading Sentinel data, in practical one we could see this in the masks folder….\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now try both approaches…\nThe first thing to note is that the Sentinel data is scaled by 10000 so in order to display this between 0 and 1 we need to divide collection using a function…\n\n//create the function\nvar divide10000 = function(image) {\n  return image.divide(10000);\n};\n\n\nLet’s load the imagery with minimal cloud cover, now depending on your study area and the propesnity for it to be cloudy (like the UK) you will need to change the dates and compromise on the less than % of cloud cover per tile…i wanted just to get 2022 data for this composite, with less than .1% cloud cover…the latter limited the images i could select from so i changed it to 1%\n\n\nvar wayone = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED')\n                  .filterDate('2022-01-01', '2022-10-31')\n                  .filterBounds(shenzhen)  // Intersecting ROI\n                  // Pre-filter to get less cloudy granules.\n                  .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE',1));\n\nvar wayone_divide = wayone.map(divide10000);\n\nvar visualization = {\n  min: 0.0,\n  max: 0.3,\n  bands: ['B4', 'B3', 'B2'],\n};\n\nMap.centerObject(shenzhen, 10);\n\nMap.addLayer(wayone_divide, visualization, 'wayoneRGB');\n\nRemember that if we wanted to see all the files we have here, we can export it to a .csv\n\nExport.table.toDrive(wayone_divide, 'exportAsCSV_wayone', 'GEE', 'CSVexport', 'CSV');\n\nFor example…i have a tile with an index 20220404T025539_20220404T030757_T49QGE\nHere….\n\nThe first part is the sensing data and time (the T) - 20220404T025539\n\nThe second part is the product generation date and time - 20220404T030757\n\nThe third part is the UTM grid reference in the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). Where T49 is the grid zone designator\n\nIn my case this gives me 13 images…now what about increasing the cloud coverage and masking the cloud pixels\n\nFirst we need another function to mask the cloudy pixels and do the division…\n\n\nfunction maskS2clouds(image) {\n  var qa = image.select('QA60');\n\n  // Bits 10 and 11 are clouds and cirrus, respectively.\n  var cloudBitMask = 1 << 10;\n  var cirrusBitMask = 1 << 11;\n\n  // Both flags should be set to zero, indicating clear conditions.\n  var mask = qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudBitMask).eq(0)\n      .and(qa.bitwiseAnd(cirrusBitMask).eq(0));\n\n  return image.updateMask(mask).divide(10000);\n}\n\nThen load and filter the collection with a cloud mask.Note a very similar method can be used for Landsat data\nOr https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/apidocs/ee-algorithms-landsat-simplecomposite\n\nvar waytwo = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED')\n                  .filterDate('2022-01-01', '2022-10-31')\n                  .filterBounds(shenzhen)  // Intersecting ROI\n                  // Pre-filter to get less cloudy granules.\n                  .filter(ee.Filter.lt('CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE',20))\n                  .map(maskS2clouds);\n                  \nMap.addLayer(waytwo, visualization, 'waytwoRGB');\n\nIn my case this produces a mixed result. I now have 62 images, but evidently the cloud mask hasn’t worked perfectly…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, there are two ways we can deal with this…\n\nTake the median image from all images in our collection - meaning the middle value of each pixel that will result in the clouds being removed (as they are very reflective and will have high values)…adding\nUse something more advanced for cloud detection such as s2cloudless\n\nTaking the median returns…."

For example pixel x has band values of 200, 300, 400 and a landcover class of grass. The row of the table is a feature, the pixel values are the properties and combined they are feature vectors.\nIn GEE the supervised classifiers include: CART, RandomForest, NaiveBayes and SVM. GEE only allows 1 million points for sampling (to train the classifier). If you have more than this you would need to take a sample.\nTo start we need some training data within our study area.

Remember that a RF is a collection of decision trees, in each tree not all the data is used and the left over data is termed the out of bag sample (OOB).After the DTs have been trained the OOB data is then applied to all the DTs that did not use it within the training data. Each DT predicts the outcome using the unseen data and the score is created through the correctly precited rows from the OOB sample across the trees. Here my error is about 1.2% which matches my accuracy of 98%.\nResubstituion accuracy is where we take the original training data and compare it to the modeled output. Mine is 99%.\nThe confusion matrix is where we held back our % of the original data calling it our validation or test data. We then trained with the model with our training data, took the model and applied it to our testing data. This matrix compares the output of the model and our validation data (which wasn’t used to train it). Mine is 98%.\n\nFinal output:\n\n6.7.1 Review questions"

If possible I strongly advise you to learn how to use its interface as multiple other data providers have similar interfaces. GitHub also place a strict size limit on files of 100MB. However, in order to account for situations like this I’ve placed the zipped file on GoogleDrive and will demonstrate how to access this from R using the new googledrive package.\nThis could be a great option for you to gain reproducibility points if you have large files that you can’t upload to GitHub.\nIn GoogleDrive you need to ensure your file is shareable with others — right click on it > Share > then copy the link. I have done this for my file in the example below, but if you try and replicate this, make sure you’ve done it otherwise it might not work when other people try and run your code, as they won’t have access to the file on your GoogleDrive.\nDepending on your internet speed this example might take some time…\nBe sure to change the path to your practical 7 folder but make sure you include the filename within it and set overwrite to T (or TRUE) if you are going to run this again.\n\nlibrary(\"googledrive\")\n\no<-drive_download(\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MV7ym_LW3Pz3MxHrk-qErN1c_nR0NWXy\",\n                  path=\"prac_7/exampleGoogleDrivedata/LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1.tar.gz\", \n                  overwrite=T)\n\nNext we need to uncompress and unzip the file with untar(), first list the files that end in the extension .gz then pass that to untar with the pipe %>% remember this basically means after this function… then…do this other function with that data\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(utils)\n\nlistfiles<-dir_info(here::here(\"prac_7\", \"exampleGoogleDrivedata\")) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, \".gz\")) %>%\n  dplyr::select(path)%>%\n  dplyr::pull()%>%\n  #print out the .gz file\n  print()%>%\n  as.character()%>%\n  utils::untar(exdir=here::here(\"prac_7\", \"exampleGoogleDrivedata\"))"

    "text": "7.6 Raster calculations\nNow we will move on to raster analysis in order to compute temperature from this raster data. To do so we need to generate additional raster layers, the first of which is NDVI\n\n7.6.1 NDVI\nLive green vegetation can be represented with the NIR and Red Bands through the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) as chlorophyll reflects in the NIR wavelength, but absorbs in the Red wavelength.\n\\[NDVI= \\frac{NIR-Red}{NIR+Red}\\]\n\n7.6.2 NDVI function\nOne of the great strengths of R is that is lets users define their own functions. Here we will practice writing a couple of basic functions to process some of the data we have been working with.\nOne of the benefits of a function is that it generalises some set of operations that can then be repeated over and again on different data… the structure of a function in R is given below:\n\nmyfunction <- function(arg1, arg2, ... ){\n  statements\n  return(object)\n}\n\nWe can use NDVI as an example…\n\nLet’s make a function called NDVIfun\n\n\n\nNDVIfun <- function(NIR, Red) {\n  NDVI <- (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)\n  return(NDVI)\n}\n\nHere we have said our function needs two arguments NIR and Red, the next line calculates NDVI based on the formula and returns it. To be able to use this function throughout our analysis either copy it into the console or make a new R script, save it in your project then call it within this code using the source() function e.g…\n\nsource('insert file name')\n\n\nTo use the function do so through…\n\n\nndvi <- NDVIfun(manc$NIR, manc$red)\n\nHere we call the function NDVIfun() and then provide the NIR and Red band.\n\nCheck the output\n\n\nndvi %>%\n  plot(.,col = rev(terrain.colors(10)), main = \"Landsat-NDVI\")\n\n\n\n# Let's look at the histogram for this dataset\nndvi %>%\n  hist(., breaks = 40, main = \"NDVI Histogram\", xlim = c(-.3,.8))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can reclassify to the raster to show use what is most likely going to vegetation based on the histogram using the 3rd quartile — anything above the 3rd quartile we assume is vegetation.\n\n\nNote, this is an assumption for demonstration purposes, if you were to do something similar in future analysis be sure to provide reasoning with linkage to literature (e.g. policy or academic)\n\n\nveg <- ndvi %>%\n  reclassify(., cbind(-Inf, 0.3, NA))\n\nveg %>%\n  plot(.,main = 'Possible Veg cover')\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s look at this in relation to Manchester as a whole\n\n\nmanc_rgb %>%\n  plotRGB(.,axes = TRUE, stretch = \"lin\", main = \"Landsat True Color Composite\")\n\nveg %>%\n  plot(., add=TRUE, legend=FALSE)"

    "text": "7.7 Advanced raster calculations\nThe goal of this final section is to set up a mini investigation to see if there is a relationship between urban area and temperature. If our hypothesis is that there is a relationship then our null is that there is not a relationship…\n\n7.7.1 Calculating tempearture from Landsat data\nHere we are going to compute temperature from Landsat data — there are many methods that can be found within literature to do so but we will use the one originally developed by Artis & Carnahan (1982), recently summarised by Guha et al. 2018 and and Avdan and Jovanovska (2016).\nSome of the terms used our outlined in the terms section at the end of the document.\n\nCalculate the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance from the Digital Number (DN) using:\n\n\\[\\lambda= Grescale * QCAL + Brescale\\]\nTOA spectral radiance is light reflected off the Earth as seen from the satellite measure in radiance units.\nIn this equation Grescale and Brescale represent the gain and bias of the image, with QCAL the Digital Number (DN) — how the raw Landsat image is captured. To go from DN to spectral radiance we use the calibration curve, created before the launch of the sensor. Bias is the spectral radiance of the sensor for a DN of 0, Gain is the gradient of the slope for other values of DN. See page 84 in RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION OF SATELLITE IMAGES: WHEN AND WHY RADIOMETRIC CORRECTION IS NECESSARY for further information.\nGrescale and Brescale are available from the .MTL file provided when you downloaded the Landsat data. Either open this file in notepad and extract the required values for band 10 gain (MULT_BAND) and bias (ADD_BAND)\n…Or we can automate it using the MTL() function within the RStoolbox package\n\nlibrary(RStoolbox)\n\nMTL<-dir_info(here::here(\"prac_7\", \"Lsatdata\")) %>%\n  dplyr::filter(str_detect(path, \"MTL.txt\")) %>%\n  dplyr::select(path)%>%\n  pull()%>%\n  readMeta()\n\n #To see all the attributes\nhead(MTL)\n\n\nNow let’s extract the values from the readMTL variable for Band 10…we can either use the function getMeta() from RStoolbox of just extract the values ourselves…\n\n\noffsetandgain <-MTL %>%\n  getMeta(\"B10_dn\", metaData = ., what = \"CALRAD\")\n\noffsetandgain\n\n       offset      gain\nB10_dn    0.1 0.0003342\n\n##OR  \noffsetandgain <- subset(MTL$CALRAD, rownames(MTL$CALRAD) == \"B10_dn\")\n\n\nRun the calculation using the band 10 raster layer\n\n\nTOA <- offsetandgain$gain *\n  lsatmask$LC08_L1TP_203023_20190513_20190521_01_T1_B10_mask + \n  offsetandgain$offset\n\n\nNext convert the TOA to Brightness Temperature \\(T_b\\) using the following equation:\n\n\\[T_b=\\frac{K_2}{ln((K_1/\\lambda)+1)}\\]\nBrightness temperature is the radiance travelling upward from the top of the atmosphere to the satellite in units of the temperature of an equivalent black body.\nK1 (774.8853) and K2 (1321.0789) are pre launch calibration constants provided by USGS.\nCheck the handbook for these values\n\nInstead of hardcoding these values…yep, you guessed it… we can extract them from our MTL\n\n\n\nCalidata <- MTL$CALBT%>%\n  terra::as.data.frame()%>%\n  mutate(Band=rownames(.))%>%\n  filter(Band==\"B10_dn\")\n\n# subset the columns\nK1 <- Calidata %>%\n  dplyr::select(K1)%>%\n  pull()\n\nK2 <- Calidata %>%\n  dplyr::select(K2)%>%\n  pull()\n\nBrighttemp <- (K2 / log((K1 / TOA) + 1))\n\nEarlier we calculated NDVI, let’s use that to determine emissivity of each pixel.\n\nFirst we need to calculate the fractional vegetation of each pixel, through the equation:\n\n\\[F_v= \\left( \\frac{NDVI - NDVI_{min}}{NDVI_{max}-NDVI_{min}} \\right)^2\\]\n\nfacveg <- (ndvi-0.2/0.5-0.2)^2\n\nFractional vegetation cover is the ratio of vertically projected area of vegetation to the total surface extent.\nHere, \\(NDVI_{min}\\) is the minimum NDVI value (0.2) where pixels are considered bare earth and \\(NDVI_{max}\\) is the value at which pixels are considered healthy vegetation (0.5)\n\nNow compute the emissivity using:\n\n\\[\\varepsilon = 0.004*F_v+0.986\\]\n\nemiss <- 0.004*facveg+0.986\n\nEmissivity is the ratio absorbed radiation energy to total incoming radiation energy compared to a blackbody (which would absorb everything), being a measure of absorptivity.\n\nGreat, we’re nearly there… get our LST following the equation from Weng et al. 2004 (also summarised in Guja et al. (2018) and Avdan and Jovanovska (2016)):\n\n\\[LST= \\frac{T_b}{1+(\\lambda \\varrho T_b / (p))ln\\varepsilon}\\]\nWhere:\n\\[p= h\\frac{c}{\\varrho}\\]\nOk, don’t freak out….let’s start with calculating \\(p\\)\nHere we have:\n\n\\(h\\) which is Plank’s constant \\(6.626 × 10^-34 Js\\)\n\\(c\\) which is the velocity of light in a vaccum \\(2.998 × 10^8 m/sec\\)\n\\(\\varrho\\) which is the Boltzmann constant of \\(1.38 × 10^-23 J/K\\)\n\n\nBoltzmann <- 1.38*10e-23\nPlank <- 6.626*10e-34\nc <- 2.998*10e8\n\np <- Plank*(c/Boltzmann)\n\nNow for the rest of the equation….we have the values for:\n\n\\(\\lambda\\) which is the effective wavelength of our data (10.9 for Landsat 8 band 10)\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) emissivity\n\\(T_b\\) Brightness Temperature\n\n\nRun the equation with our data\n\n\n#define remaining varaibles\nlambda <- 1.09e-5\n#run the LST calculation\nLST <- Brighttemp/(1 +(lambda*Brighttemp/p)*log(emiss))\n# check the values\nLST\n\nclass      : RasterLayer \ndimensions : 533, 592, 315536  (nrow, ncol, ncell)\nresolution : 30, 30  (x, y)\nextent     : 540915, 558675, 5917125, 5933115  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncrs        : +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs \nsource     : memory\nnames      : layer \nvalues     : 281.4855, 305.9571  (min, max)\n\n\n\nAre the values very high?… That’s because we are in Kevlin not degrees Celcius…let’s fix that and plot the map\n\n\nLST <- LST-273.15\nplot(LST)\n\n\n\n\nNice that’s our temperature data sorted."

    "text": "7.16 Remote sensing refresher\nLandsat sensors capture reflected solar energy, convert these data to radiance, then rescale this data into a Digital Number (DN), the latter representing the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation per pixel. The range of possible DN values depends on the sensor radiometric resolution. For example Landsat Thematic Mapper 5 (TM) measures between 0 and 255 (termed 8 bit), whilst Landsat 8 OLI measures between 0 and 65536 (termed 12 bit). These DN values can then be converted into Top of Atmosphere (TOA) radiance and TOA reflectance through available equations and known constants that are preloaded into certain software. The former is how much light the instrument sees in meaningful units whilst the latter removes the effects of the light source. However, TOA reflectance is still influenced by atmospheric effects. These atmospheric effects can be removed through atmospheric correction achievable in software such as ENVI and QGIS to give surface reflectance representing a ratio of the amount of light leaving a target to the amount of light striking it.\nWe must also consider the spectral resolution of satellite imagery, Landsat 8 OLI has 11 spectral bands and as a result is a multi-spectral sensor. As humans we see in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (red-green-blue) — this would be three bands of satellite imagery — however satellites can take advantage of the rest of the spectrum. Each band of Landsat measures in a certain part of the spectrum to produce a DN value. We can then combine these values to produce ‘colour composites’. So a ‘true’ colour composite is where red, green and blue Landsat bands are displayed (the visible spectrum). Based on the differing DN values obtained, we can pick out the unique signatures (values of all spectral bands) of each land cover type, termed spectral signature.\nFor more information read Young et al. (2017) A survival guide to Landsat preprocessing"
